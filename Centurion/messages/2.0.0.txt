Colors & Grunt!
===============

I've re-written Centurion to use Grunt. As a result you can now make your own
custom colored versions of the theme. You can check out the repo for instructions.
If you haven't used grunt before go check it out. It's not hard and it's super useful.

Galea Color Scheme
==================

I've also written an included a color theme called Galea. It's a simple color scheme designed to cut down on the use of colors in conflicting locations. There are only five colors and each relates to a high level Textmate scope.

Yellow:     Entity / Tag
Red:        Support / Keyword
Orange:     Storage
Green:      String
Blue:       Constant

Additionally each file's background is tinted to distinguish it's type. Front-end remains grey, back-end is blue and data-files are green.
